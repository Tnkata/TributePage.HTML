<h3>About the Company:</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla Inc.</a>, is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based 
    in Palo Alto, California. The company specializes in electric vehicle manufacturing, 
    battery energy storage from home to grid scale and, through its acquisition of SolarCity, 
    solar panel and solar roof tile manufacturing.

<h2>Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>
                    Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t 
                    need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and 
                    more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but 
                    also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster 
                    the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
                </p>
                <p> Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. 
                    From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – <a href="https://www.tesla.com/models">ModelS</a> – 
                    which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, ModelS has reset the 
                    world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that 
                    make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its 
                    product line with <a href="https://www.tesla.com/modelx">ModelX</a>, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star 
                    safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me">Secret 
                    Master Plan</a>,” in 2016, Tesla introduced <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3">Model3</a>, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, 
                    Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – <a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi">Tesla Semi</a> – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone.
                </p>
                <p> All Tesla vehicles are produced at its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/factory">factory</a> in Fremont, California, where the vast majority of the vehicle’s 
                    components are also made. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is taking a proactive approach to safety, 
                    requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training 
                    and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla’s safety rate continues to improve while Model 3 production ramps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">Powerwall</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerpack">Powerpack</a> and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/solarroof">Solar 
                    Roof</a>, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Tesla’s automotive and energy products is <a href="https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory">Gigafactory 1</a> – 
                    a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport 
                    and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.
